' Error is viewed, therefore, not as
an extraneous and misdirected or misdirecting accident,
but as an essential part of the process under consideration - its importance in the synthesis of automata being
fully comparable to that of the factor which is normally
considered, the intended and correct logical structure.'

-There is one important difference between ordinary
logic and the automata which represent it. Time never
occurs in logic, but every network or nervous system has a
definite t
