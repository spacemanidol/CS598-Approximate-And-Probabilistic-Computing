==+== B. Summary of the Primary Paper
==-== Markdown styling and LaTeX math supported.
The authors introduce a framework to tune various outputs of approximate computing to match a variety of optimization goals like time, energy, accuracy, temperature.
The authors build on this framework by testing their solution on a 6 well known benchmarks proving that their system can be an efficient and effective way of producing an approximate program given a set of optimization points.
The authors build this system using bayesian optimization as a way of doing efficient architecture search.

==+== C. Evaluate the Primary Paper (Pros/Cons and Discussion)
==-== Markdown styling and LaTeX math supported.
# Pros
1. Extensible program that given a series of knobs can tune a program to provide the optimal program given the various constrains
2. A clear set of benchmarks to prove how the system works and how extensible it is(arbitrary scores for given parameters).
3. Provides a method of guaranteeing a maximum error over the input even if the average is much lower. 
4. Solution is implemented in methods inspired by machine learning which allow the architecture search to run quickly and efficiently. 
# Cons
1. While the method provides a simple solution to a multi goal approximation this is not a really a novel idea. 
2. It isn't super clear why the use of bayesian methods leads to a better solution.

==+== D. Questions You Have about the Primary Paper
==-== Markdown styling and LaTeX math supported.
1. How much better or worse(in terms of efficiency) is the bayesian optimization vs other methods?
2. How does this method scale to an arbitrary number of knobs? Can it scale to 3? 4?


==+== E. Summary of the Secondary Paper (Intro)
==-== Markdown styling and LaTeX math supported.
This paper provides a framework for which to provide optimal cost of energy to run models. Given a fixed energy budget the JouleGuard method will use various approximation methods to produce a system that can operate given the energy bounds.
The JouleGuard framework is shown to operate with eight different approximation frameworks and can provide energy usage guarantees with close to optimal accuracy.
Given that many systems now are bound by some form of energy requirement, JouleGuard provides a method for optimizing all workloads given their usage parameters(e.g. phone)


==+== F. Compare the Primary and Secondary Papers
==-== (hidden from authors)
==-== Markdown styling and LaTeX math supported.
These in many ways are complementary because they both deal with 2 variable optimization for approximation. Paper one provides a framework that is agnostic of the optimization goal while paper two is firmly focused on maximizing accuracy given a fixed energy budget. 
In many ways paper 2 is a more constrained and focused use case for method 1 given a fixed knob of energy cost. 

Since paper 1 is focused on broad 2 know optimization it provides a more comprehensive evaluation focused firmly on showing that it can provide any approximation method and given variable goals. 
Paper 2 on the other hand provides a more realistic use scenario for the approximation methods as it grounds it usage in different compute platforms and their related requirements.
